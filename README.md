# TinySHRot, header-only C89 spherical harmonics rotation codes.

Based on my quite old blog post back to 2003.

TinySHRot is good for your rendering engine and game engine.

## Features

* C89 + Header-only
* SH rotation only

## Status

* Shold work (visually) correctly with unit tests, but not verified in terms of mathematical correctness(Contribution is welcome!).

## Notice

If you want fast and full-featured SH rotation code, there are good OSS codes these days, e.g. https://github.com/google/spherical-harmonics.
